% A results and discussion section which integrates answers to the questions above, assignment of spectra, 
% includes a discussion of yields and data collected. It is useful if you include subheadings etc to draw attention to 
% the answers you provide to the questions.

% As large volumes of data are generated or extensive calculations will be done, the results of these need 
% to be presented in an appropriate style (graph, table or figure) and these results need to be described 
% and discussed in the context of the experimental aims.
