It is crucial that strict quality control is imposed for the quantity of iron in a supplement to mitigate the risk of iron toxicity.

The manufacturer claims that there is 87.4mg of iron in each tablet. Despite the methodology assuming that all iron content dissolves, this greater mass calculated (see Table \ref{tab:all_mass}) is unlikely to be due to residual turbidity since measures were taken to mitigate this.
\\
Other errors may be due to condensation during the cooling of the digested samples, though measures were taken to mitigate this.
\\
Another potential source of error is the assumption that all of the iron content has reacted to form the iron(II)\textit{tris}-phenanthroline complex.
\\
All of the aforementioned errors would result in a decreased mass, which is supported by the ranges of samples b and c going below the manufacturer's claim.
\\
Despite a significant range, the data is relatively reliable due to a comparitively small standard devation. (See Table \ref{tab:all_mass}.)
